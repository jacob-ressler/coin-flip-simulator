# Coin Flip Simulator

Why flip a coin when you can just press a button to do it for you?

This is an EXTREMELY rudimentary JavaFX application to simulate flipping a coin.

## Getting started

### **Download and Usage from JAR**

Executable JAR files for all versions are available under the `_releases` directory. To always get the most recent version, click [here](<https://github.com/jacob-ressler/coin-flip-simulator/raw/master/_releases/CoinFlipSim(v1.0).jar>).

To launch the application, simply double-click the file. The following command can also be used to launch the application from a terminal:

`java -jar "CoinflipSim(v1.0).jar"`

***Note** that the version number in the command should be identical to version number of the JAR file you have downloaded for it to work properly.*

### **Building from Source**

After downloading the `src` folder, use the following command to generate the class files:

`javac CoinPane.java Coinflip.java`

To launch the application, use the command:

`java Coinflip`
